\begin{abstract}
\emph{Result diversification} aims to provide searchers with a broader view of a given topic, while attempting to maximise the chances of retrieving relevant material. Diversification of results also aims to reduce search bias by increasing the coverage over different aspects of the topic. As such, searchers should learn more about the given topic in general. Despite \emph{diversification} algorithms being introduced over two decades ago, little research has explicitly examined their impact on search behaviour and performance in the context of \emph{Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR)}. In this paper, we explore the impact of diversification when searchers undertake complex search tasks that require learning about different aspects of a topic \emph{(aspectual retrieval)}. For such aspectual retrieval tasks, diversification \emph{should} lead to performance benefits, but does it also lead to improvements on \emph{ad-hoc retrieval} tasks? In addition, how does diversification affect search behaviours and satisfaction? Based on \emph{Information Foraging Theory (IFT)}, we infer two, seemingly counter-intuitive, hypotheses, whereby diversification will lead to searchers examining fewer documents per query, and issue more queries overall. To this end, we performed a within-subjects user study using the \emph{TREC AQUAINT} collection with 51 participants, examining the differences in search performance and behaviour when using: \emph{(i)} a non-diversified system (\emph{BM25}); versus \emph{(ii)} a diversified system (BM25+\emph{xQuAD}) when the search task is either: \emph{(a)} ad-hoc; or \emph{(b)} aspectual. Our results show a number of notable findings in terms of search behaviour, with participants on the diversified system issuing more queries and examining fewer documents per query. Furthermore, we show that when using the diversified system, participants were: more confident about their decisions; more successful; and found a greater number of aspects about the given topics. We also observed that the diversified system was preferred, and led to greater success by participants, regardless of the search task. This work shows that searchers' behaviours (and thus the user model by which we evaluate retrieval systems) changes depending upon the retrieval algorithm and task. This work motivates further research into complex search tasks such as aspectual retrieval -- and how diversity can play an important role in improving the search experience, as well as potentially mitigating bias in search results.
