\begin{abstract}
Result diversification aims to provide searchers with a broader view of the topic, while trying to maximise the chances of retrieving relevant material. Diversification of results also aims to reduce search bias by increasing the coverage over different aspects of the topic and so users should learn more about the topic in general. Despite \emph{diversity} algorithms being introduced over 20 years ago, little research has explicitly examined their impact on search behaviour and performance in the context of \emph{Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR)}. In this paper, we explore the impact of diversification when searchers undertake complex search tasks, which require learning about different aspects of a topic i.e. \emph{aspectual retrieval}. For such aspectual retrieval tasks, diversification \emph{should} lead to performance benefits, but does it also lead to improvements on \emph{ad-hoc retrieval} tasks? And, how does diversification affect user's search behaviour and their satisfaction?

Based on Information Foraging Theory, we infer two, seemingly counter intuitive, hypotheses, whereby diversification 
will lead to searchers to examine fewer documents per query, and issue more queries. To this end, we performed a within-subjects user study using the \emph{TREC AQUAINT} collection with 51 participants, examining the differences in search performance and behaviour when using: \emph{(i)} a non-diversified system (\emph{BM25}); versus \emph{(ii)} a diversified system (BM25+\emph{xQuAD}) when the search task is either: \emph{(a)} ad-hoc; or \emph{(b)} aspectual. Our results show a number of notable findings in terms of search behaviour, with participants on the diversified system, issuing more queries, and examining fewer documents per query. Furthermore, we show that participants on the diversified system were more confident about their decisions, more successful, and found a greater number of aspects about the topics. We also observed that the diversified system was preferred and led to greater success by participants, regardless of the search task. This work shows that searchers' behaviours (and thus the user model by which we evaluate systems) changes depending on the retrieval algorithm and task. This work motivates further research into  complex search tasks, such as aspectual retrieval, and how diversity can play an important role in improving the search experience, as well as potentially mitigate bias in search results.
